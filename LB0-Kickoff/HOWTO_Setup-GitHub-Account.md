## Register your personal GitHub Account
Before you can start using GitHub, you need to register your own GitHub account.  
</br>

- **Step 1: Set up your account**

To register a new account, visit [GitHub.com](http://github.com) and find the 'Sign up' option on their website, 
or visit this page directly: [**https://github.com/join**](https://github.com/join)

Choose your new GitHub **username**, specify your existing **email** address 
> it's important to use your real email address because we will need to verify our account when we finalize the registration process
and the **password** of your choosing.

After that, 
> verify your account and you should be able to click the **'Create an account'** button at the bottom.  
</br>

- **Step 2: Choose your subscription**

In the second step, you can choose the **Free** subscription plan to use GitHub free of charge.
After choosing the **Free** plan, click the **'Continue'** button to go to the next step.  
</br>

- **Step 3: Tailor your experience**

This is an optional step where you can share some information about yourself if you want to. 
Otherwise, you can scroll down the page and skip that step to continue the registration process.

> Finally, you need to check the inbox of the email that you provided to **verify your email address** with GitHub.  
</br>

## Fork the KETE-HS20-WORK Repository
> Inorder to upload your exercises, your code snippets or your coding project to **KETE-HS20-WORK** repository, you need to **fork** it first. 
</br>
Check HOWTO fork a repo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSjyU2vf6Y).  
PS: If you want to work remotely, don't clone/download the repo.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a hosting platform for Git repositories.  You can use Git on its own without Github (and other similar platforms), but it's difficult to collaborate or share your code with others.

- **Git is the version control system, the tool that tracks changes to our files over time**
- **Github is a hosting service for projects that use Git.**

Make sure to first familiarize yourself with Git before proceeding.

Git is used to store projects inside *repositories* and track the complete history of all changes to the project code. Using GitHub, you can upload a local project repository to a remote cloud-based GitHub repository. You can also interact with public repositories published by other developers.

GitHub could even be looked at as a social networking website for developers. Users can follow each other, give ratings, collaborate and communicate.

GitHub allows developers to utilize, change or improve software from its repositories. Each repository contains all project files and the code history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

GitHub is also a popular way for developers to publish their project portfolio online. It's an easy way to showcase skills and experience to potential employers or clients.  It's an important technology to be familiar with, especially for a new developer who is just starting out.
